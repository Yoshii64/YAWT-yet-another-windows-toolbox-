YAWT-yet-another-windows-toolbox
all of this program uses built in windows commands and programs
it clears network cache through ipconfig
this program clears out temporary files through cd and specific commands
this launches built in windows programs through START
this also tries to fix corruption in windows through sfc and DISM
and finally installs certain programs.

this is pretty much a worse version of CTT windows toolbox with less features.
hopefully it will be better throughout the days.
